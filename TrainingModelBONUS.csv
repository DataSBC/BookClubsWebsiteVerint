2,"Everytime I chat with someone, they end the chat before I can even respond. It is very frustrating. It happened just now with Yvonne and has happened each time I have chatted with someone on several occasions. They tell me their solution and then just end the chat. They don't even ask if there is anything else I need, or even provide a normal response time for me to respond each time they send a response or question to me. Can you please relay this along as customer service is getting a bad rep for this.",Uncategorized,Customer Service Interaction
